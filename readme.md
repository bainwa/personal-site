# Personal Site
This is a website built to showcase my personal projects. Enjoy text, images and other technological marvels. Explore your choice of *two* pages and experience the web in all its glory ðŸ“¡.

## Wireframe
![Wireframe Index](./media/wireframe2.png)

The index turned out pretty close to the wireframe. I ended up deciding to go with a slider instead of a carousel.

![Wireframe About](./media/wireframe1.png)

The About Me page turned out well, I did make some adjustments to the contact box at the bottom though.
