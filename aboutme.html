      I grew up hiking the foothills of the Appalachian mountains and have recently graduated to the Rockies. I believe hiking is one of the most rewarding activities that you can participate in. The physical demands of hiking, especially uphill for extended distances, makes it a great form of exercise. It strengthens the muscles in your legs and is an excellent source of cardio. As far as sports and activities go, it's also one of the most accessible. It's open to almost every age group, and it's dirt cheap. All you need to get started is a pair of good shoes and plenty of water!

      Even though hiking is a great source of exercise, it's also much more than that. We all need to escape the stresses of our everyday lives and hiking is one of the best ways to do just that. The beauty of nature and the solitude of being alone on the trail make for a combination that few other activities can offer. I hope to bring some of the beauty of nature to you and hopefully give you some good advice and suggestions on where and how to start hiking yourself. If you have any trails or hikes you want featured on the site, please use the links below to contact me. Hopefully you enjoy the images and feel inspired to take a hike yourself. I will also probably convert this site into a portfolio for my projects, once I have more projects completed.
